{"name":"Society-theater-people","tagline":"Preliminary info on people involved in society theater","body":"# Short description of society theater\r\nIn France, the face of the generations spanning from 1750 to 1815 was a theatrical mask. These were times of passion for the theater, in public and in private. People became amateur actors with unprecedented eagerness and contributed to the creation of private stages where they could exercise their acting skills. This passion for spectacle and acting was so pronounced that it led to the invention of the term “theatromania” (la “théâtromanie”) to refer to the elites’ predilection for watching theatrical performances in the official state-funded theaters and for their enthusiasm in staging plays at home, a practice that has come to be known as “society theater.”\r\n## Some preliminary stats\r\nThere are over 350 known places of society theater only in France. The exact number of people who participated in the practice is unknown, but memoirs and other accounts indicate that many aristocrats hosted shows and acted in them. So far, I have identified 90 people known for their involvement in the practice of society theater. Of these, 20 are female and 70 are male.\r\n### Charles Collé - one of the best known society playwrights of the 18th century.\r\n![Charles Collé] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Charles_Coll%C3%A9.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
