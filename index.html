        <h1>Society theater description</h1>

<p>In France, the face of the generations spanning from 1750 to 1815 was a theatrical mask. These were times of passion for the theater, in public and in private. People became amateur actors with unprecedented eagerness and contributed to the creation of private stages where they could exercise their acting skills. This passion for spectacle and acting was so pronounced that it led to the invention of the term “theatromania” (la “théâtromanie”) to refer to the elites’ predilections for watching theatrical performances in the official state-funded theaters and for their enthusiasm in staging their own spectacles at home, a practice that has come to be known as “society theater.”</p>

<h2>Some preliminary stats</h2>

<p>Currently I have 90 people that I know for sure were involved in the practice of society theater.
Of these 90 people, 20 are female and 70 are male.</p>
