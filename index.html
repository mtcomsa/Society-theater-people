        <h1>Short description of society theater</h1>
        
<p>Society theater refers to the practice of dramatic arts initiated by various members of the 18th century French elites within their private residences. Princes, aristocrats, and wealthy bourgeois organized and often acted in theatrical productions before an audience of invited peers. As its name suggests, private theater was an intimate and exclusive phenomenon, which in many ways resembled modern home entertainment, but required more involvement on the part of its participants. Depending on the zeal of the organizers and participants, some of these private troupes could attain a semi-professional level of performance. While some hosts of private shows were motivated by their passion for dramatic literature or acting, others were merely seeking to escape boredom, or to showcase the talents of actresses with whom they maintained intimate relationships. A good number of the shows staged in theaters such as those of the Mlles Verrières or Sophie Arnould were of a libertine (i.e. erotic) nature and implied some sort of practical involvement on the part of the male spectators.</p>

<p>The most important contributors to the genre were minor playwrights like Charles Collé, Louis Carrogis Carmontelle, Pierre Laujon, François-Augustin Paradis de Moncrif, or Mme de Genlis, but well-known writers, such as Marivaux, Voltaire or Beaumarchais, also provided content and participated in the vogue of society theater. Below is a timeline of society authors and a brief overview of important events relating to theater in 18th century France.</p>

<h2>Some preliminary stats</h2>

<p>There are over 350 known places of society theater only in France. The exact number of people who participated in the practice is unknown, but memoirs and other accounts indicate that many aristocrats hosted shows and acted in them. So far, I have identified 90 people known for their involvement in the practice of society theater. Of these, 20 are female and 70 are male.</p>
